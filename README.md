# Authentication-Project


Guided by a Ruby-on-Rails course hosted by Udemy.

This is designed using Ruby for the intended purpose of having a user enter their username and password.
In doing so they will be able to access their credentials.
The user will have 3 attemps to correctly enter their password - failing to do so will prompt the user they have exceeded the acceptable number of attempts and the program will end.
